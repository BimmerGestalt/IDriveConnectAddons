The Connected Apps protocol is very powerful and provides an unparalleled convergence experience.
Here are some ideas for new apps using this functionality.

## Car Data Service

The car provides [so much data](https://hufman.github.io/BMWConnectedAnalysis/cds/), what are good ways to show it to the user?

- Trip logger, both locally and to the cloud in real-time
- Scrobbling of car-sourced music such as SiriusXM or USB
- Live gauges display of some basic performance data, without needing extra hardware

## Legacy Apps

There used to be some incredibly innovative features using the Connected Apps protocol, perhaps they can be brought back and updated?

- Official Twitter client could be reused for Mastodon
- Perhaps integrated with the official RSS News reader
- Dynamic Music would be fun
- Sports Displays could be reused for accelerometer display, perhaps?
- Smart Things could be a frontend for Home Assistant
- The GoPro app inspires a dashboard-integrated dashcam control/view interface, perhaps with support for real GoPros

## Unknown Possibilities

The protocol has some other APIs which haven't been fully explored, such as the Map api that takes a KMZ file.

- Add a POI layer to show speed traps
