Ideas for new features using the IDrive Connected Apps protocol

The Connected Apps protocol is very powerful and provides an unparalleled convergence experience.
Even beyond the remote UI, the protocol exposes some high level data from the car.
Here are some ideas for new apps using this functionality.

## Car Data Service

The car provides [so much data](https://hufman.github.io/BMWConnectedAnalysis/cds/), what are good ways to show it to the user?

- Trip logger, both locally and to the cloud in real-time
- Scrobbling of car-sourced music such as SiriusXM or USB
- Live gauges display of some basic performance data, without needing extra hardware
